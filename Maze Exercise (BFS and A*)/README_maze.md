- The implementation of the provided code was inspired by the pseudocode presented in the course slides. 
- The isGoal and nextStates functions were developed following the logic outlined in the slides. 
- Additionally, credit is due to the CS50 AI programming with Python course (Week 0, available at https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/0/) for the code that generates images of mazes. 
- This code was fully inspired, copied, and adapted to meet the specific requirements of our exercise. 
- The maze used in this implementation is derived from the CS50 course's maze but has been adjusted to work seamlessly with our array-based approach, considering that CS50 primarily works with plain text.
-  It's important to note that the coloring mechanism is designed to accommodate any starting and ending points within the maze.
- It's worth mentioning that the code requires the installation of the PIL library, achieved with the command `pip install pillow`. This library, which includes the Image and ImageDraw modules, is essential for creating visual representations of mazes.
- Moreover, the implementation showcases versatility, as it can handle mazes of various structures, providing adaptability to different scenarios and allowing for exploration beyond the confines of the original CS50 maze format.
